// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Easy
[ShortDesc]According to the information recovered by my forensics team, our target—the person responsible for my family's suffering—is Lord Parzival Gurung, the head of a minor noble house from Atreus. Lord Gurung is well connected and well defended. If we're going to capture him, first we must strike against his bodyguard.
[LongDesc]Looks like Force Commander Singh's forensics team bought the false intel we planted. Let's hope it leads to the payoff we were promised.

	[Content]Thanks to you, Commander, I finally know who's been attacking my family. In retrospect, his identity should have been obvious to me. My father sent Gurung's mother to prison for sedition nearly 20 years ago, and evidently he's still holding a grudge.

	[Content]When Gurung's bodyguard is down, we'll immediately press the attack on his stronghold. I have no doubt that the villain will flee if given the chance; we must deny him the opportunity.
